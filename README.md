# ContractCallKit

ContractCallKit is a set of utility libraries that could be used to interact with other deployed contracts on-chain it simplifies and makes it intuitive to use, The current libraries support only solidity libraries support for ink and other major languages will be updated soon.

**Algorithum**

LibCaller (sol) algorithm: 

       1: function callFunctionParams(targetContract, functionName, paramsData)

       2:     success, returnData = targetContract.staticcall(abi.encodeWithSignature(functionName, paramsData))

       3:     if success:

       4:         return returnData

       5:     else:

       6:         revert("Call failed")

staticcall function (sol) algorithm:

       1: function staticcall(address targetContract, bytes calldata data) external view returns (bool success, bytes memory returnData)

       2:     result = targetContract.call(data)

       3:     if result:

       4:         returnData = result.data

       5:         success = true

       6:    else:

       7:        success = false

       8:        returnData = bytes([])

       9:    end if

       10: end function

**Contract Interaction Using `address.call()` in Ethereum Smart Contracts**

Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain often require interactions with other deployed contracts to retrieve data or perform specific actions. The `address.call()` function serves as a fundamental low-level tool for facilitating these interactions. This paper elucidates the workings of `address.call()` and its significance in enabling secure and efficient communication between Ethereum smart contracts.

**1. Function Invocation**

In Ethereum's smart contract ecosystem, invoking external contract functions is crucial. `address.call()` method serves as the conduit for invoking functions on a target contract specified by the `address` parameter. This mechanism empowers developers to establish inter-contract communication seamlessly.

**2. Data Encoding**

Central to the operation of `address.call()` is the provision of function call data in bytes format. This encapsulates the function's unique selector, derived from its name and parameter types. Additionally, any requisite arguments are included, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the desired function invocation.

**3. Execution Context**

Understanding the execution context of `address.call()` is essential. The invoked function executes within the context of the calling contract. Notably, any modifications made to the target contract's state, such as altering internal variables, remain confined to the calling contract. This ensures the integrity of the target contract's state while allowing informative queries.

**4. Gas and State**

Gas consumption is pivotal in Ethereum transactions. For `address.call()`, the function's execution consumes gas proportional to its complexity. If gas is exhausted during the invocation, execution halts, and any state changes that occurred within the target contract are rolled back. Consequently, `address.call()` is commonly used for read-only operations to minimize potential gas-related issues.

**5. Return Value**

Upon invoking `address.call()`, a tuple is returned, comprising a boolean value `success` and a `bytes` array `data`. `success` indicates the success of the call, while `data` holds any returned information from the target contract. Developers can assess this tuple to ascertain the status of the call and access any pertinent data.

**6. Handling Failures**

Given the dynamic nature of blockchain environments, interactions can fail due to various reasons. In such cases, the `success` boolean in the returned tuple will be `false`. Properly handling these failures, often through graceful reversion or informative error messages, is imperative for maintaining the reliability of the smart contract.

**7. No State Changes**

`address.call()` is deliberately designed to operate within a confined execution context, devoid of persistent state changes in the target contract. Its primary application lies in querying data or interacting with functions marked as `view` or `pure`.

In essence, `address.call()` provides a vital avenue for secure and controlled contract-to-contract communication on Ethereum. Its mechanics enable developers to obtain data from external contracts efficiently while adhering to the principles of gas efficiency and graceful error handling. Proper utilization of this function ensures the seamless integration of smart contracts within the Ethereum ecosystem.
